# Problem Statement and Motivation
- AI has played a major role in the digitalization of society and creating new technologies than ever before, but, on the other hand, 
Ethics, principles, democracy, equalities, criminal justice and morality  are important human features and AI still grow uncontrollably lack of these features, without any scientific models, or theoretical foundation that could investigate, evaluate, improve and invest in the  AI Techs regarding to  human development 
- AI Techs in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge is a Hot Project. It is happening now
- We live in world of AI fake news and propaganda

# Research objective 
The major research question will answer in this project are:

RQ1:

- What would AI-based approaches on archival principles look like? 
- What possibilities do they suggest about humane AI development?
- Do they counter the “black box” character of AI?

RQ2:

- What benefits would an archival AI offer an institution and society? 
- Could it help future-proof cultural heritage institutions, i.e., foster heritage futures? 
- Can an archival AI, outside the archival setting, serve public interest (e.g., combating fake news and propaganda)?

The primary objective of this research is to develop a quantitative and qualitative methods to design an effective system to answer RQ 1 and RQ 2.

# Goal
Investigate and evaluate the AI Techs is required to empower people, transform lives, benefit the institutions and societies, help future-proof cultural heritage institutions, serve public interest, approaching the archival principles and humane AI development.
 


# Research Method

## Data collection
- Optimization: optimize quality of record
- Digitization: digitize record into computable formats (Doc,PGN,MP4,MP3)
- Extract the relevant information from the Digitalized-Records
Name of the record
Type of the Record: (False Information, cultural heritage, or Human Development)
## Data analysis
- AI in False Information analysis

misinformation = Fake news, False News, Satire news, Disinformation, Misinformation, and Rumer

- AI Techs in cultural heritage analysis
- AI Techs in humane development
