<a href="https://github.com/HeiderJeffer/Ph.D-position-at-Linnaeus-University/blob/main/README.md#project-laboratory">Here is the Project Laboratory</a>.


I creat an AI/ML/DL Project Lab. Please Pay a Visit for our <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jw7D6sPe303Ky1bxFcIY8Xjzj2v76jax?usp=drive_link">AI/ML/DL Project Lab</a> , you can find all  AI/ML/DL apps and codes that I write for this project, I am working and making experiments, to develop and design apps that reflect the nature of this project.

# Why I Chose this Project?

# Problem Statement and Motivation
- AI has played a major role in the digitalization of society and creating new technologies than ever before, but, on the other hand, 
Ethics, principles, democracy, equalities, criminal justice and morality ¬†are important human features¬†and AI still grow uncontrollably lack of these features, without any scientific models, or theoretical foundation that could investigate, evaluate, improve and invest in the  AI Techs regarding to  human development 
- AI Techs in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge is a Hot Project. It is happening now
- We live in world of AI fake news and propaganda

- We live in these outcomes, they are the biggest threat modern humans have ever faced, and still happening now in (2023) the time I am writing this presentation, therefore, together, with history, archival science, digital humanities, media technology, and computer science, we should start quickly in this project to address and investigate these challenges and to contribute new knowledge to the fields, as soon as humanly possible.
- Investigate and evaluate the AI Techs is required to empower people, transform lives, benefit the institutions and societies, help future-proof cultural heritage institutions, serve public interest, approaching the archival principles and humane development.

# Research objective 
The major research question will answer in this project are:
## RQ1:
- What would AI-based approaches on archival principles look like? 
- What possibilities do they suggest about humane AI development?
- Do they counter the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù character of AI?

## RQ2:
- What benefits would an archival AI offer an institution and society? 
- Could it help future-proof cultural heritage institutions, i.e., foster heritage futures? 
- Can an archival AI, outside the archival setting, serve public interest (e.g., combating fake news and propaganda)?

The primary objective of this research is to develop a quantitative and qualitative methods to design an effective system to answer RQ 1 and RQ 2.

# Purpose and aims 
- Overall, the scientific significance and novelty of the project responds to international and European incentives for ethical democratising and a more humane AI
- Ongoing partnership, producing original research, training/teaching  students and other highly qualified personal. 
- Generating a virtuous circle with: history, archival science, digital humanities, computer science and media technology.
- Looking for feedback loop: to reinforce and exchange  the knowledge capabilities and ideas with each party.

### AI Technologies
is a variety of digital technologies and methods for automated information processing and data mining.

### Finding study
- Study1: convert scanned manuscripts to a format that can be accessed by information retrieval systems or for further analysis.
- Study2: recognition techniques to pre-process historical texts, thereby improving its clarity for accessing the records.
- Study3: represent supervised machine learning to identify sensitive information in archival documents to facilitate ethical archival research  
- Study 4,5: techniques to make the AI model explainable 
- Study 6: shows that AI technologies are often treated as a (black box).
- Study 7: about Archival practices: authenticity of purported records.  
- Study 8: Understanding authentication as dynamic and reflexive instead of  static and stable.

# Research Approach
This study is designed to be exploratory. The overall data collection and analysis process employed in the study showing in next UML diagram and explained in detail in the following text.

## Data collection
### Step 1 Import records from the Swedish National Archives and the Swedish National Heritage
- Results Collection A: records are imported
### Step 2 Apply inclusion/ exclusion criteria
![alt text](https://github.com/HeiderJeffer/Ph.D-position-at-Linnaeus-University/blob/main/presentation/image/9.PNG)
Resluts  (Collection B): inclusion/ exclusion criteria applied

### Step 3 Digitalization:  convert record into computable formats (DOC, PNG, MP3, and MP4)
- Digitization is the process of converting information into a digital format. 
- Convert the data in (Collection B) into (DOC, PNG, MP3, and MP4) format
- Results (Collection C): Digitalized-Record in (DOC, PNG, MP3, and MP4) format

### Step 4 Optimization: optimize quality of Digitalized-Record
- Implement ML/DL in (Collection C) to optimaize the data's quality 
- Results (Collection D): Data quality optimized

### Step 5 Extract the relevant information from the Digitalized-Record 
- Implement ML/DL in (Collection D) to extract the following info

Name of the record, Type of the Record

False Information, cultural heritage,  Human Development

- Implement  ML/DL to find: (1. Topics modeling 2 clustering 3. K-means)
- Results (Collection E):  Digitalized-Record with relevant information

## Data analysis
### Step 6 AI in False Information analysis
- Implement ML/DL in (Collection E) to extract the following
![alt text](https://github.com/HeiderJeffer/Ph.D-position-at-Linnaeus-University/blob/main/presentation/image/10.PNG)

- Implement  ML/DL to find: (1. Topics modeling 2 clustering 3. K-means)

- Results (Collection F):  AI in False Information analysis: groups of (Misinformation, AI Attack, AI Defense) distributed into identical classes 

### Step 7 AI Techs in cultural heritage analysis
- Implement ML/DL in (Collection E) to extract the following:

 Society, Language, Culture, Religion , Geographic, Population, Capita, Political system.

- Implement ML/DL to find: (1. Topics modeling 2 clustering 3. K-means)
- Results (Collection G): a groups of (AI cultural heritage) distributed into identical classes 

###  Step 8 AI Techs in humane development
-  Implement ML/DL in (Collection E) to extract the following:

Country, Condition of Dev,, Empowerments, Education state, Civil rights state, Climate Change state(Sustainability), LGBTQ state, Woman Rights State, Human Rights State, Equal opportunity, Health Care system, Criminal Justice State, Transparency state, Access to public info state.

- Implement ML/DL to find (1. Topics modeling 2 clustering 3. K-means)
- Results (Collection H): AI humane development analysis distributed into identical groups/classes 




## Expected Results

Research finding  showing in diagram (Collection F) , (Collection G), and (Collection H) are the answers for RQ1 and RQ2 that we addressed in this project.
