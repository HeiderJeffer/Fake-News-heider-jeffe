# Problem Statement and Motivation
- AI has played a major role in the digitalization of society and creating new technologies than ever before, but, on the other hand, 
Ethics, principles, democracy, equalities, criminal justice and morality  are important human features and AI still grow uncontrollably lack of these features, without any scientific models, or theoretical foundation that could investigate, evaluate, improve and invest in the  AI Techs regarding to  human development 
- AI Techs in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge is a Hot Project. It is happening now
- We live in world of AI fake news and propaganda

- We live in these outcomes, they are the biggest threat modern humans have ever faced, and still happening now in (2023) the time I am writing this presentation, therefore, together, with history, archival science, digital humanities, media technology, and computer science, we should start quickly in this project to address and investigate these challenges and to contribute new knowledge to the fields, as soon as humanly possible.

- Investigate and evaluate the AI Techs is required to empower people, transform lives, benefit the institutions and societies, help future-proof cultural heritage institutions, serve public interest, approaching the archival principles and humane development.



# Research objective 
The major research question will answer in this project are:

## RQ1:

- What would AI-based approaches on archival principles look like? 
- What possibilities do they suggest about humane AI development?
- Do they counter the “black box” character of AI?

## RQ2:

- What benefits would an archival AI offer an institution and society? 
- Could it help future-proof cultural heritage institutions, i.e., foster heritage futures? 
- Can an archival AI, outside the archival setting, serve public interest (e.g., combating fake news and propaganda)?

The primary objective of this research is to develop a quantitative and qualitative methods to design an effective system to answer RQ 1 and RQ 2.

# Purpose and aims 
- Overall, the scientific significance and novelty of the project responds to international and European incentives for ethical democratising and a more humane AI
- Ongoing partnership, producing original research, training/teaching  students and other highly qualified personal. 
- Generating a virtuous circle with: history, archival science, digital humanities, computer science and media technology.
- Looking for feedback loop: to reinforce and exchange  the knowledge capabilities and ideas with each party.

### AI Technologies
is a variety of digital technologies and methods for automated information processing and data mining.

### Finding study
- Study1: convert scanned manuscripts to a format that can be accessed by information retrieval systems or for further analysis.
- Study2: recognition techniques to pre-process historical texts, thereby improving its clarity for accessing the records.
- Study3: represent supervised machine learning to identify sensitive information in archival documents to facilitate ethical archival research  
- Study 4,5: techniques to make the AI model explainable 
- Study 6: shows that AI technologies are often treated as a (black box).
- Study 7: about Archival practices: authenticity of purported records.  
- Study 8: Understanding authentication as dynamic and reflexive instead of  static and stable.

# Research Approach
## Data collection
### Step 1 Import records from the Swedish National Archives and the Swedish National Heritage
- Step Results records are imported
### Step 2 Apply inclusion/ exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria
1. Records are freely accessible by all party and available at any time
2. Records are in English
3. Records can be digitized 
4. Records imported from imported from SNA (Swedish National Archives) and SNH (Swedish National Heritage)

Exclusion criteria
1. Records are freely accessible by all party and available at any time
2. Records are not in English
3. Records can not be digitized
4. Imported from Slideshare, Quora, Twitter Facebook, LinkedIn, personal (or company) blogs

- Step Resluts: inclusion/ exclusion criteria applied

### Step 3 Digitalization:  convert record into computable formats (DOC, PNG, MP3, and MP4)
Digitization is the process of converting information into a digital format. 
- Step Results: Digitalized-Record in (DOC, PNG, MP3, and MP4) format

### Step 4 Optimization: optimize quality of Digitalized-Record
- Step Results: Digitalized-Record with optimal quality

### Step 5 Extract the relevant information from the Digitalized-Record 
- From Digitalized-Record in (DOC, PNG, MP3, and MP4) format, extract the following info
    - Name of the record, Type of the Record
    - False Information, cultural heritage,  Human Development
- Implement (1. Topics modeling 2 clustering 3. K-means)
-Step Results:  Digitalized-Record with relevant information

## Data analysis

### Step 6 AI in False Information analysis
- To understand the AI applications and how these technologies can support the spread of misinformation (AI-Powered Fake News 2.0).
- misinformation = Fake news, False News, Satire news, Disinformation, Misinformation, and Rumer.
  - AI Attack:
    - AI who Create Fake Post in Web
    - AI who Spread Fake Post to group of people
  - AI Defense:
    - AI Fake News Detector to detect Create Fake Post 
    - AI SocialBot Detector to detect Spread Fake Post 

- Input = DOC, MP3 and MP4
- Implement (1. Topics modeling 2 clustering 3. K-means)
- Step Results  AI in False Information analysis

### Step 7 AI Techs in cultural heritage analysis
- Input = DOC, MP3 and MP4
- Extract the following: Society, Language, Culture, Religion , Geographic, Population, Capita, Political system.
- Implement (1. Topics modeling 2 clustering 3. K-means)
- Step Results: AI cultural heritage analysis

###  Step 8 AI Techs in humane development

- Input = DOC, MP3 and MP4
- Extract the following: Country, Condition of Dev,, Empowerments, Education state, Civil rights state, Climate Change state(Sustainability), LGBTQ state, Woman Rights State, Human Rights State, Equal opportunity, Health Care system, Criminal Justice State, Transparency state, Access to public info state, (by UN measurement).
- Implement (1. Topics modeling 2 clustering 3. K-means)
- Step Results: AI humane development analysis

## Finally
by following the above steps we will answer the RQ1 and RQ2 addressed in this project.
