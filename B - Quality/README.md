# Research objective 
The major research question will answer in this project are:
RQ1:
What would AI-based approaches on archival principles look like? 

What possibilities do they suggest about humane AI development? 

Do they counter the “black box” character of AI?

RQ2:

What benefits would an archival AI offer an institution and society? 

Could it help future-proof cultural heritage institutions, i.e., foster heritage futures? 

Can an archival AI, outside the archival setting, serve public interest (e.g., combating fake news and propaganda)?

The primary objective of this research is to develop a quantitative and qualitative methods to design an effective system to answer RQ 1 and RQ 2.

# Goal
Investigate and evaluate the AI Techs is required to empower people, transform lives, benefit the institutions and societies, help future-proof cultural heritage institutions, serve public interest, approaching the archival principles and humane AI development.
